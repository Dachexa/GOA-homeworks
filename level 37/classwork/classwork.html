        Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, <br> the youngest of his siblings to be born,<br> though sometimes reckoned the eldest <br> as the others required disgorging from <br> Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he <br> is married to Hera, by whom he is usually <br> said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, <br> and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, <br> his consort was said to be Dione, by whom <br> the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. <br> According to the Theogony, Zeus's first wife <br> was Metis, by whom he had Athena. <br>Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. <br>These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, <br> including Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, <br> Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, <br> and the Muses.
